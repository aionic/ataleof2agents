# Agent Framework Reference Implementation

**Build once, deploy anywhere**: A practical reference for building AI agents that work in both self-hosted (Azure Container Apps) and managed (Azure AI Foundry) environments.

> **Use Case**: Weather-based clothing advisor (throwaway example)
> **Real Value**: Portable agent pattern you can adapt for any external API integration

## Why This Repo?

You're evaluating Agent Framework and need to decide:
- **Container Apps** (self-hosted): Full control, faster responses
- **Foundry** (managed): No infrastructure, built-in orchestration
- **Both**: Why not have options?

**This repo shows you**: Same agent code works in both environments. Choose based on your needs, not code limitations.

---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### What You'll Build
An AI agent that:
1. Calls an external weather API
2. Applies AI reasoning
3. Returns clothing recommendations

### Deploy to Container Apps
```powershell
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd agentdemo
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Configure (add your keys to .env)
cp .env.example .env

# Deploy
./deploy/container-app/deploy.ps1
```

### Deploy to Foundry
```powershell
# Register agent in Foundry
cd src/agent-foundry
python register_agent.py

# Test it
python test_agent.py
```

**⏱️ Total time**: ~15 minutes per deployment

---

## Choose Your Path

### 🚀 Container Apps (Self-Hosted)
**Best for**:
- High-volume workloads (2.3x faster responses)
- Full infrastructure control
- Custom networking requirements

**You get**:
- Docker containers deployed to Azure Container Apps
- Direct HTTP API calls
- Managed identity authentication
- Application Insights monitoring

👉 **[Container Apps Deployment Guide](./docs/DEPLOYMENT-CONTAINER-APPS.md)**

---

### ☁️ Azure AI Foundry (Managed)
**Best for**:
- Rapid development
- No infrastructure management
- Built-in agent orchestration

**You get**:
- Managed agent runtime
- OpenAPI tool integration
- Built-in conversation threads
- Foundry portal UI

👉 **[Foundry Deployment Guide](./docs/DEPLOYMENT-FOUNDRY.md)**

---

### 🔄 Both (Side-by-Side)
**Best for**:
- Evaluating performance/cost
- Hybrid deployment strategies
- Migration scenarios

**Compare**:
- Same agent code, two deployment models
- See performance differences (tested: Container Apps 4.68s avg vs Foundry 10.88s avg)
- Cost analysis: 70% savings with hybrid pattern

## What's Inside

### Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Agent (Either deployment model)                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • Orchestrates workflow                                │
│  • Calls external Weather API                           │
│  • Applies AI reasoning (Azure OpenAI)                  │
│  • Returns recommendations                              │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
         External Weather API
         (OpenWeatherMap via Container Apps)
```

**Key Concept**: The agent calls external HTTP APIs - not embedded functions. This makes it portable.

## Example: Weather Clothing Advisor

**What it does**: Takes a zip code, gets weather, recommends clothing.

**Why it matters**: Simple enough to understand quickly, complex enough to show real patterns.

**Your use case**: Replace weather API with your own external service. The pattern stays the same.

### Try It

**Container Apps**:
```bash
curl https://ca-weather-dev-<your-id>.azurecontainerapps.io/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What should I wear in 10001?"}'
```

**Foundry**:
```python
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

client = AIProjectClient.from_connection_string(
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
    conn_str="<your-connection-string>"
)

# Create thread and run agent
thread = client.agents.threads.create()
message = client.agents.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="What should I wear in 10001?"
)
run = client.agents.runs.create_and_process(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    agent_id="<your-agent-id>"
)
```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Agent Framework
Microsoft's framework for building AI agents with:
- Declarative configuration (YAML)
- External API integration (OpenAPI)
- Workflow orchestration
- Portability across environments

### 2. External API Pattern
**Traditional**: Agent → Embedded function → External API
**This pattern**: Agent → External HTTP API (directly)

**Why**: Portability. HTTP APIs work everywhere.

### 3. Deployment Models
**Container Apps**: You manage Docker containers
**Foundry**: Microsoft manages the runtime
**Your agent code**: Works in both

### 4. Cost Optimization
**Agent-only**: Expensive (every request uses LLM)
**Hybrid**: 70% cheaper (use business logic for simple cases, agents for complex reasoning)

👉 **[Workflow Patterns Guide](./docs/WORKFLOW-ORCHESTRATION-PATTERNS.md)**

## Performance

Based on 7 test cases across both deployments:

| Metric | Container Apps | Foundry | Winner |
|--------|---------------|---------|--------|
| **Success Rate** | 100% (7/7) | 100% (7/7) | Tie ✅ |
| **Avg Response Time** | 4.68s | 10.88s | Container Apps 🚀 |
| **Setup Complexity** | High | Low | Foundry 👍 |
| **Cost (high volume)** | Lower | Higher | Container Apps 💰 |
| **Maintenance** | You | Microsoft | Foundry ⚙️ |

**Verdict**: Both work reliably. Choose based on your priorities.
